# Fetch_Rewards
Assessment for Fetch UIUC


There were 3 steps to finish in order to complete the Data analytics challenge.

Step 1 : To create relational diagrams.
My solution is uploaded within two image files found within the repository named : Relational Schema model and Fetch diagram

Step 2: To write SQL queries for the following :
Which brand saw the most dollars spent in the month of June?
Which user spent the most money in the month of August?
What user bought the most expensive item?
What is the name of the most expensive item purchased?
How many users scanned in each month?

My solution is included within the Fetch_Rewards.ipynb file within the repository.
I have answered all questions and highlighted the solutions. I used sqlite imported from python's libraries.

Step 3: To be able to communicate facts to non-technical stakeholders 

I have included my findings within the last section of my python notebook, once again within the file Fetch_Rewards.ipynb
The 'store name' and 'category' image files are the word clouds that can draw attention of the non-technical audiences to major information about the dataset.
